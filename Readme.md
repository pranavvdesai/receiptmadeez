# ReceiptmadeEz

A simple application to store all receipts of products purhcased by a user. 

## Problem at hand

In the ideal world today, all receipts for any product purchased are given out physically. And as all of us at some point are careless, we may tend to lose the receipt and thus probably lose the opportunity to claim for a warranty. Also, there is no centralised platform today to store the receipts of products purchased by a user. 
For example, if X buys a washing machine, he/she only gets a physical receipt issued which has important details like the product ID, product name, etc. 
Another thing is that if a user wants to apply for a warranty, in most of the cases has to call the company executive to apply for warranty, which is a tiresome process in itself. 

## What ReceiptmadeEz solves
It eliminates the concept of physical receipts for a product and is also a platform to store all receipts for products bought by the user. Apart from that, we're also providing the functionality for the user to directly apply for warranty using our service itself, thus eliminating the need for the company spokesperson to check for the waranty eligibilty and enabling us as users to do the same directly. If the user is eligible for warranty, the user can fill out a form claiming for warranty uploading relevant information and supporting photos to state his reason for applying for the same. A company admin will then verify the details and revert back with accept or reject. The advantage with this is that everything comes under the hood, thus eliminating the elaborate processes of applying for warranty and getting it approved. 


## Future Scope

- Degrading NFTs - Once a user generates a receipt, it will be saved as an NFT in the user collection, and this NFT will be degrading, which means that it will degrade once the warranty period comes to an end. Along with ownership of the product, we also have digital ownership of the product with NFTs.

- As of now for hackathon purposes, we are having our own marketplace for users to buy products(which is not the USP), but in the real world, it will be an extension to websites where users can buy and then connect to our application to view the saved invoices and proceed thereafter to claim for warranty(if applicable).
